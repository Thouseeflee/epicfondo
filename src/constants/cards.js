      content: `It was 2 AM and John and Maria were driving their rental car through the dark and winding roads of a remote countryside. They were foreigners, unfamiliar with the area, and were hoping to reach their destination before dawn. However, fate had different plans for them.

As they drove, they suddenly heard a strange sound coming from the nearby woods. It sounded like a pack of wolves howling in unison. John hit the brakes and brought the car to a screeching halt. Maria's heart was racing as they both looked around, trying to see if there was any danger.

Just then, an old woman appeared out of nowhere. She looked to be in her sixties, with a wrinkled face and piercing blue eyes. She told John and Maria that they were in grave danger and needed to take shelter immediately.

Without a second thought, the couple followed the old woman into a nearby cabin. It was a small, run-down shack, but it was better than being out in the open with the wolves. The old woman lit a candle and the dim light flickered around the cabin.

As they settled in, John and Maria began to feel uneasy. They could hear the howling of the wolves getting louder and closer. The old woman sensed their fear and told them a story that sent chills down their spines.

She spoke of a legend that had been passed down through generations. According to the legend, on nights when the full moon shone bright, the wolves came out of the woods and preyed on unsuspecting travelers. The old woman said that they needed to be cautious and stay hidden until morning.

Suddenly, they heard a loud banging on the door. The wolves were at the cabin, trying to break in. The old woman hurriedly ushered John and Maria into a hidden room, where they waited in fear as the wolves tried to enter the cabin.

The night seemed to stretch on endlessly, with the sound of the wolves never fading. However, as the first rays of light began to break through the window, the howling gradually died down. The old woman emerged from the hidden room and beckoned John and Maria to follow her out.

As they stepped outside, they saw that the wolves had disappeared into the woods. The old woman looked at them with a serious expression and warned them never to drive through those roads at night again. John and Maria nodded in agreement, and with a newfound respect for the dangers of the wilderness, they continued on their journey, grateful to have survived the night.
